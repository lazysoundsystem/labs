<a href='http://reliefweb.int/help/api'>ReliefWeb's API</a> enables new tools using ReliefWeb content. As a part of the potential tools to be built using the API, we're launching a disaster tracker prototype to enable filtered access to reports along with external data like Twitter, EM-DAT Disaster Database, and UNDP's Human Development Index. Check out the <a href='https://github.com/reliefweb/disaster-tracker'>open source code</a> on Github.
